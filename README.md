# Hotel API Flask Assignment


###Project Overview
The Hotel API Flask Assignment is a multi-microservice project designed to provide modular backend functionality for a hotel management system. The project is built using Python's Flask framework and follows a RESTful architecture. It includes the following three microservices:

User Service - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
Destination Service - Manages hotel destination data.
Authentication Service - Provides JWT-based authentication and token management.

This project demonstrates separation of concerns by splitting responsibilities across microservices and emphasizes secure user authentication.
